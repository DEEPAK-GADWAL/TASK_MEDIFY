   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hospital-management-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd hospital-management-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Usage

Our Hospital Management App is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. Here's how you can use some of the key features:

### Searching for Nearby Hospitals

1. On the homepage, locate the "Find Hospitals" section.
2. Enter your city or zip code in the search bar.
3. (Optional) Use the filters to narrow down your search by hospital type, services offered, or ratings.
4. Click the "Search" button to see a list of hospitals near you.
5. Browse through the results to view details such as address, contact information, and available services.

### Booking an Appointment

1. Find a doctor or hospital using the search feature described above.
2. Click on the doctor's or hospital's profile to view more details.
3. Look for the "Book Appointment" button and click it.
4. Select your preferred date and time from the available slots.
5. Fill in the required information (name, contact details, reason for visit, etc.).
6. Review your appointment details and click "Confirm Booking".
7. You'll receive a confirmation message and email (in a real application) with your appointment details.

### Additional Features

- **View Doctor Profiles**: Click on a doctor's name to see their full profile, including specializations, education, experience, and patient reviews.
- **Read Health Articles**: Navigate to the "Blog and News" section to stay informed about health topics and hospital updates.
- **Check FAQs**: Visit the FAQ section for quick answers to common questions about appointments, hospital policies, and services.

Remember, as this app currently uses dummy data, no real appointments will be made. In a production version, these actions would interact with a real database and potentially integrate with the hospital's actual scheduling system.
